# Dashboard Manufacturing Guide

* Attempted to use DXFs exported from Fusion and imported into Adobe Illustrator

* Illustrator would not detect the text as closed shapes, and thus it would not engrave properly

* Instead, I removed these elements, and used the text tool in Adobe Illustrator

* For the Highlander Racing logo, I found the PNG in the Google Drive and pasted it into the AI file

* This process got the engraving to work properly on the Trotec engravers

# NJIT-Highlander-Racing-Electrical 

A GitHub Organization for NJIT's Highlander Racing Electrical Subteam

This organization contains individual repositories for each subsystem on the car, including:
* Dashboard (Andrew)
* Semi-Active Suspension (Shawn and Erik L)
* CVT Tachometer/Temperature Sensor (Eric M)
* Driver's Seat Pressure Sensors (Matt)
* Gas/Brake/Steering Angle Sensors (Shawn and Erik L)
* Fuel Level Sensor (Snehil)
* Dedicated Data Acquisition Logger
* GPS (Alex)
* 2WD/4WD Engagement Switch
* Power Research (Channy)

## 2023 Design Goals 
* Custom PCBs for subsystems where applicable
* Custom durable and compact 3D printed enclosures for subsystems
* All data outputs from subsystems are shared with each other via CAN-Bus
* Any data on the CAN-Bus is saved to a dedicated DAQ logger
* Single battery that powers all subsystems
* Universal power and data connections/cables throughout the vehicle
* Strong design process documentation (photos, schematics, research, etc)

## Electrical Design Timeline

### October
* Finish research
* Create a Bill of Materials (BOM)
* Meet with me about your proposed design
* Order Parts!

### November
* Work on breadboard prototyping and programming

### December
* Finalize breadboard design and have a close-to-finished program
* Create schematics for custom PCBs (if necessary)
* Make sure you account for CAN-Bus and 12V-5V power conversion!
* Order PCBs (if necessary)

### January
* Solder all components for permanent design (on PCB if necessary)
* Test circuit and program to ensure everything works
* Begin designing enclosures for your specific components
* Accessible enclosures with cable holes and assembled with screws
* Compact and durable

### February
* Final design and program improvements
* Begin testing subsystems together (dashboard, DAQ logger, CAN-Bus, power systems, etc) 
* Post summary of information to GitHub (if not done already)
* Schematics, code files, photos of device, data, research, etc
* Assemble systems on car (if the car is done)

### March
* Assemble systems on car and drive the car to test!

### April-May
* Competition! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
* April 25-28, 2024
* May 16-19, 2024


## CAN-Bus Message ID Hierarchy

With CAN-Bus, data is constantly being sent to and from all devices in the loop. While not every device is set to receive every message, it is important that there is a hierarchy to the messages. This way, more crucial data is sent first. Our Message ID hierarchy can be found in this repository.

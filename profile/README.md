# NJIT-Highlander-Racing-Electrical 

## A GitHub Organization for NJIT's Highlander Racing Electrical Subteam

This organization contains individual repositories for each subsystem on the car, including:
* Dashboard (Nicolas)
* CVT Tachometer (Yahil)
* Driver's Seat Pressure Sensors
* Gas/Brake/Steering Angle Sensors (Nicolas -- steering)
* Fuel Level Sensor (Stephen)
* Dedicated Data Acquisition Logger with GPS (Alex)
* PC Base Station (Abhi, Ethan)
* Wheel Speed Sensors (Andrew)
* Suspension Displacement (Gerad)
* Power Systems (Channy)
* Enclosures (Kamsi)
* CAN-Bus (Sachin)

## 2024-2025 Design Goals 
* Custom PCBs for subsystems where applicable
* All data outputs from subsystems are shared with each other via CAN-Bus
* Any data on the CAN-Bus is saved to a dedicated DAQ logger
* Strong design process documentation (photos, schematics, research, etc)

## Electrical Design Timeline

### September
* Assign existing projects and research based on interest and experience
* Decide on potential new projects
* Look into what parts and sensors are best for the job

### October
* Finish research
* Create a Bill of Materials (BOM)
* Meet with me about your proposed design
* Order Parts!

### November
* Work on breadboard prototyping and programming

### December
* Finalize breadboard design and have a close-to-finished program
* Create schematics for custom PCBs (if necessary)
* Make sure you account for CAN-Bus and 12V-5V power conversion!
* Order PCBs (if necessary)

### January
* Solder all components for permanent design (on PCB if necessary)
* Test circuit and program to ensure everything works
* Begin designing enclosures for your specific components
* Accessible enclosures with cable holes and assembled with screws
* Compact and durable

### February
* Final design and program improvements
* Begin testing subsystems together (dashboard, DAQ logger, CAN-Bus, power systems, etc) 
* Post summary of information to GitHub (if not done already)
* Schematics, code files, photos of device, data, research, etc
* Assemble systems on car (if the car is done)

### March
* Assemble systems on car and drive the car to test!

### April-May
* Competition! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
* Season Wrap-up
* Make sure all documentation is posted to the GitHub
* Mentioned what worked well, what didn't, and what we can improve on for next year


## Andrew's List of Things to Do
* Fabricate more kill switch mounting plates
    * This includes both the rear square tab with two 1/8" rivet holes and the front tab that wraps around the switch body
* Design a new mounting bracket for the newer version of brake light
* **Fix 2WD/4WD switch 9V/12V toggle that got bonked at comp**
* **Reach out to RuggedRadios soon for 2025 sponsorship**

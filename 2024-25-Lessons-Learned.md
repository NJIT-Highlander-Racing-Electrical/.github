* Lessons Learned during 2024-2025 season

** Enclosures

*** Modeling Dimensions

Since all of the enclosures are relatively the same, it would have been much easier to have one master template with variables for length, width, and height dimensions that could easily be changed for each subsystem to accomodate different sized PCBs

*** Gaskets

The gasket material we used this year was a bit annoying to work with. Because it has a fabric-y feel, it was hard to laser cut cleanly. It also did not adhere to the acrylic covers with superglue very well because the superglue absorbed into the material.

*** Cover Screws

Two things to do with this. One, a screw on top and bottom instead of just the sides would have been beneficial so the acrylic doesnt arch in the middle. Additionally, some of the screw threads got messed up when making them into thumb screws, so maybe find a better way to attach the plastic knobs for that
